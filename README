AnyEvent-KVStore

This module provides a unified API for key-value stores for AnyEvent.  This is
intended to allow you to easily plug various stores for such things into an
AnyEvent application and perform the basic operations on it.  These include:

   connect
   read
   write
   watch

The specific implementations use other modules released separately.  For
example, see AnyEvent::KVStore::Etcd.

Major applications include things like cluster management via event loops and
the like.
